var str = "Hello, playground"

/*
 * Let's try a few basics - please type this into your playground
 */
var a = 10
a = a + 1
a = a - 4
a = a * a

// In the result pane, you'll see 10, 11, 7, and 49 respectively.
// Now try this
var b = 26
b += 10
b -= 9

// When it comes to strings, + will join them together. For example:
var name1 = "Thanh Nguyen"
var name2 = "Nguyen Thanh"
var both = name1 + " and " + name2

// That will write "Thanh Nguyen and Nguyen Thanh" into the result pane
